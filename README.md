# Vubuntu-Alpha
The Ubuntu Flavor for Developers that gets things done.
Vubuntu is only in Its Alpha Phase, SO major changes may happen in this time.
There are Multiple Versions, and you can download them from the link provided in the txt files. I would recommend you to use 1.1.2, so you can test it and give me feedback.
To see the Details of the ISO file please download from the google drive link and extract.
Please make sure to INSTALL (Not try) Vubuntu before giving feedback.
Please Check Release Notes (Three Paragraphs Below) to see all pre-installed software.).

WARNINGS:

Using Vubuntu as your main OS currently is not recommended. Please use it in a VM. If you want, you can install it on a partition on a junk computer to install for testing. VUBUNTU DOES NOT GET PROPER UPDATES YET. If you are testing Vubuntu, please INSTALL it on a junk computer or on a VM. DO NOT try it out and judge it. Vubuntu 1.1.1 is not a public release, so donâ€™t worry about it. Thanks!
