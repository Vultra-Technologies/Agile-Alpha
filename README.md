# Vubuntu-Alpha
The Ubuntu Flavor for Developers that gets things done.
Vubuntu is only in Its Alpha Phase, SO major changes may happen in this time.
There are 2 versions, 1.0 and 1.1. I would recommend you to use 1.1, so you can test it and give me feedback.
To see Details of the ISO file please download from the google drive link and extract.
Please make sure to INSTALL (Not try) Vubuntu before giving feedback.
VirtualBox, VBox Ext pack, Geary Mail, and XPad are all of the Pre-Installed software.

What to expect in Alpha 1.2 (Next Version): Updated Boot Logo, Updated Installer, More Software, Bug Fixes


I am using Cubic on Ubuntu to make this flavor. (I am basically chrooting into the environment.).
